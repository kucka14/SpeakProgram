look carefully at how the couplet association map is updated
    does this make sense? is it producing interesting results after multiple texts?
    see what is actually happening to the couplet association map
        it currently appears to not have any effect: look into this

maybe have a way to standardize the couplet map and query that directly
    instead of doing a calculation each time
